--- abstract

This document defines extensions for HTTP Datagram-based protocols that improve transmission efficiency by introducing templates for compressing or deriving datagram fields.

These templates allow endpoints to define parts of datagrams that are static and can be removed, and other parts that can be derived (such as packet lengths and checksum values).

Additionally, this document defines a checksum offload procedure enabling receivers to complete Internet checksums using sender-provided partial values.

These optimisations reduce per-packet overhead, processing cost, and increase the effective maximum transmission unit (MTU) when datagrams are encapsulated in QUIC DATAGRAM frames.

# Introduction

The CONNECT-IP method {{!CONNECT-IP=RFC9484}} allows an HTTP client to establish an IP tunnel through an HTTP proxy and exchange IP packets using either HTTP/3 Datagrams ({{Section 2.1 of !HTTP-DATAGRAMS=RFC9297}}) or DATAGRAM capsules ({{Section 3.5 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}). Similarly, CONNECT-ETHERNET {{!CONNECT-ETHERNET=I-D.ietf-masque-connect-ethernet}} allows sending Ethernet frames over HTTP Datagrams. These protocols send complete packets or frames by default, including all transport and network headers. This is a simple approach, but incurs per-packet overhead due to the repeated transmission of largely invariant header fields.

Other HTTP Datagram-based protocols share similar properties: datagrams often contain structured packets where many header fields remain constant across a flow while only a subset of bytes change between packets. Transmitting complete packets therefore wastes bandwidth and processing resources.

This document introduces a set of optional extensions that define Processing Contexts for HTTP Datagram payloads. A Processing Context describes transformations applied to a received datagram payload prior to delivery to the target protocol and may reference a parent context, forming a processing chain.

Reusable templates allow endpoints to associate a Context Identifier with a reusable packet layout consisting of static and variable byte regions. Once a template has been installed using reliable Capsules, datagrams referencing the same Context Identifier carry only the variable portions of the packet. This reduces the size of transmitted datagrams and processing overhead, while remaining compatibile with intermediaries that are unaware of these optimisations.

Derived field processing allows the receiver to reconstruct certain header fields (for example packet length fields and complete checksums) based on the size and structure of the reconstructed packet. This eliminates the need for the sender to transmit such fields for every packet.

In addition, this document defines a checksum offload procedure enabling endpoints to cooperatively compute Internet checksums, where the sender provides a partial checksum and the receiver completes the computation after reconstruction. This mirrors hardware checksum-offload behavior used on network interfaces and tunnel devices, reducing per-packet CPU cost for encapsulating or decapsulating CONNECT-IP and CONNECT-ETHERNET traffic.

When HTTP Datagrams are encapsulated in QUIC DATAGRAM frames, these optimisations also increase the effective maximum transmission unit (MTU) by reducing the number of bytes carried inside each QUIC packet.

All extensions are negotiated during the HTTP request/response handshake and signalled using Capsules on the reliable control stream. Endpoints can always fall back to transmitting complete datagrams using Context Identifier 0, which represents unoptimised datagrams containing the full payload as defined by the underlying HTTP Datagram protocol.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used in this document:

Context Identifier (Context ID):

: A numeric identifier associated with a Processing Context. Context ID encoding and allocation follow the rules defined in {{Section 4 of !CONNECT-UDP=RFC9298}}. Context ID 0 indicates that the datagram payload is delivered without additional processing as defined by the underlying HTTP Datagram protocol.

Processing Context:

: A set of rules describing how an HTTP Datagram payload is transformed before delivery to the target protocol. A Processing Context may reference a parent context, forming a processing chain. Processing Contexts are immutable once created.

Template:

: A reusable packet layout consisting of a sequence of static and variable segments. Static segments contain bytes removed from optimized datagrams, while variable segments correspond to bytes still carried in the datagram payload.

Derived Field:

: A header field whose value is generated by the receiver during reconstruction and written into the reconstructed packet rather than being transmitted in the datagram payload. Derived fields include length fields and complete checksums.

Checksum Offload:

: A capability allowing the receiver to complete the Internet checksum according to {{!INCREMENTAL-CHECKSUM=RFC1624}} using a sender-provided partial checksum after reconstruction of the packet.

Capsule:

: A reliable control-stream message, as defined in {{Section 3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}, used in this specification to signal creation, acknowledgement, or deletion of Processing Contexts.

# Negotiation of Capabilities {#negotiation}

Endpoints negotiate support for HTTP Datagram processing contexts during the HTTP request/response handshake by using the `http-datagram-contexts` HTTP header field, whose value is a Structured Field Dictionary as defined in {{Section 3.2 of !STRUCTURED-HTTP=RFC8941}}.

## Header Definition

~~~
http-datagram-contexts = sf-dictionary
~~~
{: #fig-http-datagram-contexts-header title="http-datagram-contexts header field"}

This document defines the following optional dictionary keys:

`max-templates` (Integer):

: Maximum number of concurrently active template contexts the sender is willing to maintain for templates created by the peer. Absence of this key or value of 0 indicates that the sender does not support reusable templates.

`max-templates-segments` (Integer):

: Maximum number of static segments accepted within a single template. Absence of this key or value of 0 indicates that the sender does not impose a limit on number of static segments in a single template.

`derived` (Inner List):

: A list of supported Derived Field Types as defined in {{iana-derived-fields}}.

`checksum` (Boolean):

: Indicates support for the checksum offload procedure defined in this document. A value of ?1 means the endpoint is willing to complete checksums using sender-provided partial values. If omitted or set to ?0, checksum offload is not supported.

`mtu` (Integer):

: Upper limit on maximum reconstructed packet size the receiver is willing to accept.

Endpoints MUST ignore unknown dictionary members. The absence of a member implies that the corresponding capability is not supported for contexts created by the peer.

## Negotiation Behavior

Capabilities are directional. Each endpoint advertises the processing contexts it is willing to receive and maintain for datagrams sent by the peer. An endpoint MAY create a context only if the peer advertised support for the corresponding capability.

### Templates

If the peer advertises the `max-templates`  value greater than 0, the endpoint MAY create template contexts up to that limit using capsules defined in {{capsules}}.

An endpoint MUST NOT create templates exceeding the peer's advertised `max-template-segments` limit when that parameter is present.

If the peer advertises an `mtu` limit, the sender MUST NOT transmit a datagram that would reconstruct into a packet larger than the advertised limit after all processing contexts have been applied.

### Derived Fields

An endpoint MAY create a derived context only if every operation in the capsule appears in the peer's `derived` list.

### Checksum Offload

An endpoint MAY create a checksum offload context only if the peer advertised `checksum=?1`.

## Example

HTTP/3 sample request (client to proxy):

~~~
:method = CONNECT
:protocol = connect-ip
:scheme = https
:path = /.well-known/masque/ip/*/*/
:authority = proxy.example.net
capsule-protocol = ?1
http-datagram-contexts = max-templates=20000, max-templates-segments=32, derived=(0 2 4), checksum=?1, mtu=1500
~~~
{: #fig-connect-ip-http-datagram-contexts-request-example title="CONNECT-IP with http-datagram-contexts request example"}

HTTP/3 sample response (proxy to client):

~~~
:status = 200
capsule-protocol = ?1
http-datagram-contexts = max-templates=65535, derived=(0 1), checksum=?0, mtu=1500
~~~
{: #fig-connect-ip-http-datagram-contexts-response-example title="CONNECT-IP with http-datagram-contexts response example"}

In this example, both peers support reusable templates. The proxy supports a subset of derived fields (ipv4-total-length, ipv4-udp-length and ipv4-header-checksum) and the checksum offload. The client supports a different subset of derived fields (ipv4-total-length and ipv6-payload-length) without the checksum offload. Both endpoints indicate that the maximum packet size after reconstruction must not exceed 1500 bytes.

# Processing Context Capsules {#capsules}

This specification defines multiple capsule types to construct, acknowledge, and delete processing contexts.

## Processing Context Overview

### Processing Context Construction {#assign}

Processing contexts are created using capsules that define a new unique non-zero `Context ID` encoded as a variable-length integer. A Context ID MUST NOT be reused. As specified in {{Section 4 of CONNECT-UDP}}, even-numbered Context IDs are allocated by the client and odd-numbered by the proxy.

Each processing context MAY reference an already-defined parent context using `Next Context ID` encoded as a variable-length integer. A context MUST reference only a Context ID previously defined by the peer. Forward references are not permitted. Processing context without a parent is identified by `Next Context ID` set to 0. A processing chain MUST NOT contain more than one context of the same type. A receiver that detects such a condition MUST treat the context as malformed and follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

A receiver of an *_ASSIGN capsule with an invalid `Context ID` or unknown `Next Context ID` MUST treat it as malformed and follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

### Processing Context Acknowledgement {#ack}

For each *_ASSIGN capsule received, the receiver MUST transmit the corresponding *_ACK capsule after successfully installing the context.

Endpoints MAY transmit datagrams referencing contexts prior to receiving the *_ACK. A receiver MAY buffer datagrams referencing unknown Context IDs but MUST bound buffering by time and memory.

A receiver of an *_ACK capsule with an unknown Context ID or any data after Context ID MUST treat it as malformed and follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

### Processing Context Closure {#close}

Processing Contexts are retired by sending corresponding *_CLOSE capsule. Closing a context implicitly closes all contexts that reference it directly or transitively.

A receiver of a *_CLOSE capsule SHOULD retain the closed context and its descendants for a short period to allow in-flight datagrams to arrive, but MUST bound the retention time and memory usage.

*_CLOSE capsules with unknown Context ID or any data after Context ID MUST be treated as malformed. Receiver of such capsules MUST follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

## Template Capsules

### TEMPLATE_ASSIGN Capsule {#template-assign}

~~~
TEMPLATE_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee3143f,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
  Next Context ID (i),
  Static Segment (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #fig-template-assign-capsule title="TEMPLATE_ASSIGN Capsule Format"}

The TEMPLATE_ASSIGN capsule contains a sequence of one or more Static Segments.

~~~
Static Segment {
  Segment Offset (i),
  Segment Length (i),
  Segment Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-static-segment title="Static Segment Format"}

Each Static Segment contains following fields:

Segment Offset:

: Byte offset from the start of the reconstructed packet, encoded as a variable-length integer

Segment Length:

: Length of the Segement Payload field, encoded as a variable-length integer

Segment Payload:

: Static bytes to insert at the Segment Offset

#### Parsing and validation

The receiver parses a TEMPLATE_ASSIGN capsule by reading, in order: the Context ID, the Next Context ID, and one or more static segments whose encodings consume exactly the remaining length of the capsule. Context ID and Next Context ID processing is described in {{assign}}.

Each Static Segment consists of a Segment Offset, a Segment Length, and exactly Segment Length octets of Segment Payload. Static segments MUST appear in strictly increasing Segment Offset order and MUST NOT overlap. There MUST be at least 1 byte between consecutive segments.

A receiver that advertised a `max-templates-segments` limit MUST ensure that the template does not contain more static segments. A receiver that advertised a `mtu` limit in `http-datagram-contexts` MUST ensure that the sum of Segment Offset and Segment Length of the final segment does not exceed the MTU limit. Final reconstructed packet size validation is performed during packet reconstruction ({{reconstruction}}). The capsule MUST end immediately after the last static segment.

If any of the capsule fields are malformed upon reception, the receiver of the capsule MUST follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

A receiver that has already accepted the maximum number of templates it advertised via the `max-templates` member in `http-datagram-contexts` MUST treat any additional TEMPLATE_ASSIGN capsule an error and MUST follow the same error-handling procedure.

Per-packet validation uses the reconstruction procedure described in {{reconstruction}}.

### TEMPLATE_ACK Capsule

~~~
TEMPLATE_ACK Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31440,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-template-ack-capsule title="TEMPLATE_ACK Capsule Format"}

Processing of the TEMPLATE_ACK capsule is described in {{ack}}

### TEMPLATE_CLOSE Capsule

~~~
TEMPLATE_CLOSE Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31441,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-template-close-capsule title="TEMPLATE_CLOSE Capsule Format"}

Processing of the TEMPLATE_CLOSE capsule is described in {{close}}

## Derived Field Capsules

### DERIVED_ASSIGN Capsule

~~~
DERIVED_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31442,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
  Next Context ID (i),
  Derived Field Type (i) ...
}
~~~
{: #fig-derived-assign-capsule title="DERIVED_ASSIGN Capsule Format"}

The DERIVED_ASSIGN capsule defines a processing context that generates and inserts one or more derived fields into the reconstructed packet. The sender does not transmit these fields in the datagram payload.

#### Parsing and validation

The receiver parses a DERIVED_ASSIGN capsule by reading, in order: the Context ID, the Next Context ID, and one or more Derived Field Type values encoded as variable-length integers. Context ID and Next Context ID processing is described in {{assign}}.

If a Derived Field Type is not present in the receiver's advertised `derived` capability list in `http-datagram-contexts` or if any Derived Field Type appears more than once in the capsule, the receiver MUST treat the capsule as malformed and follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

Per-packet validation uses the reconstruction procedure described in {{reconstruction}}.

### DERIVED_ACK Capsule

~~~
DERIVED_ACK Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31443,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-derived-ack-capsule title="DERIVED_ACK Capsule Format"}

Processing of the DERIVED_ACK capsule is described in {{ack}}

### DERIVED_CLOSE Capsule

~~~
DERIVED_CLOSE Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31444,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-derived-close-capsule title="DERIVED_CLOSE Capsule Format"}

Processing of the DERIVED_CLOSE capsule is described in {{close}}

## Checksum Offload Capsules

### CHECKSUM_ASSIGN Capsule

~~~
CHECKSUM_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31445,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
  Next Context ID (i),
  Checksum Field Offset (i),
  Checksum Start Offset (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-checksum-assign-capsule title="CHECKSUM_ASSIGN Capsule Format"}

The CHECKSUM_ASSIGN capsule defines a processing context that completes an Internet checksum for the reconstructed packet using a sender-provided partial checksum.

In addition to `Context ID` and `Next Context ID` CHECKSUM_ASSIGN capsule contains following fields encoded as variable-length integers:

`Checksum Field Offset`:

: Byte offset of the 16-bit Internet checksum field within the reconstructed packet

`Checksum Start Offset`:

: Byte offset where checksum coverage begins.  Coverage runs from this offset to the end of the reconstructed packet.

#### Parsing and validation

The receiver parses a CHECKSUM_ASSIGN capsule by reading, in order: the Context ID, the Next Context ID, Checksum Field Offset and Checksum Start Offset. Context ID and Next Context ID processing is described in {{assign}}.

If the peer did not advertise `checksum=?1` in `http-datagram-contexts`, the receiver MUST treat the capsule as malformed and follow the error-handling procedure defined in {{Section 3.3 of HTTP-DATAGRAMS}}.

If `Checksum Start Offset` is 0, the receiver MUST treat the capsule as malformed and follow the same error-handling procedure.

Per-packet validation uses the reconstruction procedure described in {{reconstruction}}.

### CHECKSUM_ACK Capsule

~~~
CHECKSUM_ACK Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31446,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-checksum-ack-capsule title="CHECKSUM_ACK Capsule Format"}

Processing of the CHECKSUM_ACK capsule is described in {{ack}}

### CHECKSUM_CLOSE Capsule

~~~
CHECKSUM_CLOSE Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31447,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-checksum-close-capsule title="CHECKSUM_CLOSE Capsule Format"}

Processing of the CHECKSUM_CLOSE capsule is described in {{close}}

# Processing Context Operation

This section defines how endpoints construct and consume HTTP Datagram payloads using Processing Contexts.

A datagram carries a Context Identifier that selects the initial Processing Context. A context MAY reference a parent context using Next Context ID. The complete behavior is defined by recursively following parent contexts until reaching Context ID 0.

Context ID 0 indicates that no processing is applied and the payload is delivered unchanged to the underlying HTTP Datagram protocol.

## Sender behavior

When sending a datagram using a Processing Context, the sender constructs the payload so that the receiver can reconstruct the final packet after applying the processing chain.

The sender MUST use a Context ID only after the corresponding *_ASSIGN capsule has been transmitted.

### Template Contexts

If the selected context chain contains a Template context, the sender constructs the datagram payload as the concatenation of all variable byte regions not covered by static segments.

Variable regions are emitted in strictly increasing offset order starting at offset 0.

If the context chain contains no Template context, the payload MUST be the complete packet.

### Derived Field Contexts

Derived fields are not transmitted by the sender. When a derived context is in use, the sender MUST remove the octets corresponding to derived fields from the datagram payload. These octets are supplied by the receiver during reconstruction.

The sender MUST construct the payload as if the derived field octets were not part of the variable regions. That is, the payload MUST contain only the remaining variable octets in strictly increasing offset order.

### Checksum Offload Contexts

If the context chain contains a checksum offload context, the sender MUST place a precomputed partial Internet checksum value into the checksum field at Checksum Field Offset in the reconstructed packet image prior to transmission. This value is combined with the receiver computation as described in {{reconstruction}}.

### Context Selection

If a packet does not match any available context, the sender MUST use Context ID 0 and transmit the complete packet.

## Receiver behavior {#reconstruction}

Upon receiving an HTTP Datagram with a non-zero Context ID, the receiver retrieves the referenced Processing Context and recursively resolves its parent contexts until Context ID 0 is reached.

If any referenced context is unknown, the receiver MAY buffer the datagram as described in {{ack}} or drop it.

If multiple processing contexts are present in a chain, the receiver MUST apply them in the following order:

1. Template reconstruction (if present)
1. Derived field processing (if present)
1. Checksum offload processing (if present)

### Template Reconstruction

If a Template context is present, the receiver reconstructs the packet as follows:

1. Allocate a buffer large enough to contain the reconstructed packet.
1. Insert static segment bytes at their specified offsets.
1. Fill all remaining gaps using bytes from the datagram payload in strictly increasing offset order.

If payload bytes are exhausted before all gaps have been filled the datagram MUST be dropped.

Packets larger than the advertised `mtu` in `http-datagram-contexts` MUST be dropped.

### Derived Field Processing

For each derived field present in the context chain, the receiver computes the field value and inserts it into the reconstructed packet at the location defined by the derived field type.

Derived fields are inserted into the packet image and therefore increase the reconstructed packet size. The receiver MUST compute derived field values based on the final reconstructed packet size and structure.

Initial field definitions are specified in {{iana-derived-fields}}.

If the required header cannot be located, the packet MUST be dropped.

### Checksum Offload Processing

If a checksum offload context is present, the receiver completes the Internet checksum after all derived fields have been inserted.

The receiver completes the checksum as follows:

1. Treat the checksum field as zero.
1. Compute the one's-complement sum from Checksum Start Offset to L.
1. Add (fold) the 16-bit value currently present at the checksum field.
1. Write the final one's-complement result to the checksum field.

If any offset exceeds the reconstructed packet length, the packet MUST be dropped.

# Examples

This section illustrates how contexts are created and how senders form compact payloads. All offsets and lengths are in bits in the packet diagrams and field tables. All offsets and lengths are in bytes in segment tables and sample capsules.

## CONNECT-IP: TCP over IPv6 with template, derived fields and checksum offload

Original sample {{?TCP=RFC9293}} over {{?IPv6=RFC8200}} packet layout is illustrated below. In addition to basic IPv6 and TCP headers it contains Timestamp option as defined in {{Section 3 of ?TCP-PERF=RFC7323}}.

This packet is to be transmitted from the client to the proxy over CONNECT-IP.

{: #original-tcp-ipv6 title="Example TCP over IPv6 packet before optimization"}

This example assumes that the peer supports templates with at least two segments per template, IPv6 payload length derived field and checksum offloading. These capabilities were communicated using the following `http-datagram-contexts` HTTP field in proxy response confirming CONNECT-IP extended CONNECT.

~~~
http-datagram-contexts = max-templates=1, max-templates-segments=2, derived=(1), checksum=?1, mtu=1500
~~~
{: #fig-http-datagram-contexts-example-1 title="http-datagram-contexts response example"}

Since the proxy does not support TCP checksum derivation, but it supports checksum offloading, the client calculates checksum of IPv6 pseudo-header and places it in the TCP checksum field. Context for the offloaded checksum is defined using the CHECKSUM_ASSIGN capsule:

~~~
CHECKSUM_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31445,
  Length (i) = 4,
  Context ID (i) = 2,
  Next Context ID (i) = 0,
  Checksum Field Offset (i) = 56,
  Checksum Start Offset (i) = 40,
}
~~~
{: #ipv6-tcp-checksum-assign title="CHECKSUM_ASSIGN Capsule for example IPv6/TCP packet"}

Payload length field in IPv6 header can derived by the peer, so it is removed before calculating static segments. Resulting context for the derived field is defined using DERIVED_ASSIGN capsule:

~~~
DERIVED_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31442,
  Length (i) = 3,
  Context ID (i) = 4,
  Next Context ID (i) = 2,
  Derived Field Type (i) = 1

  Type (i) = 0x3ee3143f,
  Length (i) = 54,

The resulting processing context chain reduces per-packet overhead by removing 50 bytes of repeated header material, increasing the effective MTU when datagrams are encapsulated in QUIC DATAGRAM frames.

The sender concatenates all variable regions in increasing offset order. Packets that do not match this template (for example packets with IPv6 extension headers or without TCP options) are sent using Context ID 0 or associated with a new context.

Upon receiving the datagram with Context ID 6, proxy re-assembles the datagram by concatenating static and variable segments according to the offsets, re-calculates Payload Length and inserts it into IPv6 header and completes the TCP checksum using the sender-provided pseudo-header partial checksum.

## CONNECT-ETHERNET: UDP over IPv4 with template and derived fields

Original sample {{?UDP=RFC768}} over {{?IPv4=RFC791}} Ethernet frame layout is illustrated below.

This frame is to be transmitted from the proxy to the client over CONNECT-ETHERNET.

{: #original-udp-ipv4-ethernet title="Example UDP over IPv4 Ethernet frame before optimization"}

This example assumes that the peer supports templates, IPv4 total length, IPv4 header checksum, UDP length in IPv4 packet and UDP checksum in IPv4 packet derived field. These capabilities were communicated using the following `http-datagram-contexts` HTTP field in client requesting CONNECT-ETHERNET extended CONNECT.

~~~
http-datagram-contexts = max-templates=1, max-templates-segments=1, derived=(0 2 4 7), mtu=1500
~~~
{: #fig-http-datagram-contexts-example-2 title="http-datagram-contexts request example"}

Total length and header checksum in IPv4 header as well as length and checksum in UDP header can be derived by the peer, so these fields are removed before calculating static segments. Resulting context for the derived field is defined using DERIVED_ASSIGN capsule:

~~~
DERIVED_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0x3ee31442,
  Length (i) = 6,
  Context ID (i) = 1,
  Next Context ID (i) = 0,
  Derived Field Type (i) = 0
  Derived Field Type (i) = 2
  Derived Field Type (i) = 4
  Derived Field Type (i) = 7
}

A single static segment model can be used for the initial part of the HTTP datagram after derived fields were removed:

  Length (i) = 38,
  Context ID (i) = 3,
  Next Context ID (i) = 1,
  Static Segment {
    Segment Offset (i) = 0,
    Segment Length (i) = 34,
    Segment Payload = 0x00005E00530100005E00530208004502000040004011c0000201c0000202c1991151,

The resulting processing context chain reduces per-frame overhead by removing 34 bytes of repeated header material, increasing the effective MTU when datagrams are encapsulated in QUIC DATAGRAM frames.

The sender concatenates all variable regions in increasing offset order.

Upon receiving the datagram with Context ID 3, client re-assembles the datagram by appending variable segments to the static, re-calculates derived fields and inserts them at appropriate locations in the datagram.

# Security Considerations

This specification changes how HTTP Datagrams are reconstructed but does not weaken transport-layer integrity or confidentiality protections provided by the underlying HTTP mapping. All Capsules travel on the reliable control stream and inherit those protections.

## Resource Exhaustion

Processing contexts introduce receiver state and reconstruction work. An attacker could attempt to exhaust memory or CPU by creating excessive numbers of templates and static segments, purposely sending datagrams referencing not-yet-installed contexts and causing excessive buffering of unknown Context IDs.

Implementations MUST enforce limits on number of active templates and static segments and restrict memory used for buffering datagrams with unknown contexts.

## Amplification

Derived fields and template reconstruction increase the size of the reconstructed packet relative to the received datagram payload. An attacker could exploit this to amplify processing cost and perform a denial-of-service attack.

Endpoints MUST ensure that reconstructed packet size does not exceed the negotiated MTU and SHOULD apply rate limiting when expansion ratios are abnormally high.

# IANA Considerations

Type:

: A positive integer identifying the field type

Name:

: A short name of the field

Description:

: A description of the field

Protocols:

: A list of HTTP Upgrade Tokens that the derived field type can apply

Reference:

: An optional reference defining the use of the entry.

The registry's initial entries are as follows:

Type | Name | Description | Protocols | Reference
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | ipv4-total-length | IPv4 Total Length field derived from reconstructed packet size | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
1 | ipv6-payload-length | IPv6 Payload Length field derived from reconstructed packet size | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
2 | ipv4-udp-length | UDP Length derived from UDP header to end of IPv4 packet | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
3 | ipv6-udp-length | UDP Length derived from UDP header to end of IPv6 packet | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
4 | ipv4-header-checksum | IPv4 header checksum computed over IPv4 header | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
5 | ipv4-tcp-checksum | TCP checksum computed over IPv4 pseudo-header and segment | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
6 | ipv6-tcp-checksum | TCP checksum computed over IPv6 pseudo-header and segment | connect-ip, connect-ethernet | This document
